==== Bug Fixes

* The `Launcher` (specifically `LauncherDiscoveryResult`) now retains the original
  `TestEngine` registration order after pruning test engines without tests, thereby
  ensuring reliable test execution order of multiple test engines.

==== New Features and Improvements

* The `execute(TestPlan,{nbsp}TestExecutionListener...)` and
  `execute(LauncherDiscoveryRequest,{nbsp}TestExecutionListener...)` methods in the
  `Launcher` API are no longer deprecated.
* New `discoveryRequest()` method in `{LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder}`, which is an
  alias for the existing `request()` method and is intended to be used via a `static`
  import.
* New `executionRequest(...)` methods in `{LauncherExecutionRequestBuilder}`, which are
  aliases for the existing `request(...)` methods and are intended to be used via a
  `static` import.
* New `selectClasses(...)` and `selectClassesByName(...)` factory methods have been
  introduced in `{DiscoverySelectors}` to simplify use cases where one needs to select
  multiple individual test classes for the `Launcher` or `EngineTestKit`.
* New `selectors(List)` builder method for `{EngineTestKit}` which can be used in
  conjunction with the new `selectClasses(...)` and `selectClassesByName(...)` factory
  methods in `DiscoverySelectors`.
